# Basic Website Starter

A minimal, accessible starter you can customize.

## Quick start
1. Open `index.html` in your browser. Edit the text to make it yours.
2. Change the page title in `<title>` and the header brand text.
3. Replace section content (About, Projects, Contact). Add real project links.
4. Optional: add images to `assets/img/` and reference them in your HTML.
5. Publish (two easy options below).

## Publish for free
### Option A: GitHub Pages
1. Create a new repository on GitHub and name it anything you like.
2. Upload all the files from this folder (or push with Git).
3. On the repo, go to **Settings â†’ Pages** and set the source to `main` and root folder.
4. Wait a minute, then open the link GitHub provides.

### Option B: Netlify (drag-and-drop)
1. Go to Netlify and create an account.
2. Drag this entire folder onto the dashboard to deploy.

## Customize
- Colors: edit the CSS variables at the top of `assets/css/style.css`.
- Fonts: swap the `font-family` on `body`.
- Sections: duplicate a `<section>` block in `index.html` to add more.
- Form: replace with a `mailto:you@example.com` link or connect a form service.

## Learn more (optional)
- HTML: headings, links, lists, forms.
- CSS: layout with Flexbox/Grid, spacing, colors, and responsive design.
- Accessibility: use proper headings, labels, alt text, and keyboard focus.
